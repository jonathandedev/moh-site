          <p>Messages of Hope is a campaign that encourages anyone and everyone to 
            write anonymous messages for people that are going through a difficult 
            time, and/or struggling with their mental health.
            <br /><br />
            Your messages of hope are posted on social media, daily.
            <br /><br />
            You can submit your message of hope below or keep an eye out for any 
            collaborative art projects we may be hosting in your area. We use 
            these events to collect messages of hope and engage with the wider 
            community on a more personal level.

          <p>Messages of Hope aims to spread hope, connect communities and give 
            people a platform to have their voices heard.
            <br><br>
            When working with your business/organisation/charity/project/school 
            or community, our aim is to create a collaborative art piece that 
            you can keep and display however you please. We will work with you in 
            deciding the most appropriate way of running our project with you. We 
            will explore what you would like your final piece of art to look like, 
            who the participants are and what you are hoping to gain from working 
            with Messages of Hope.
            <br><br>
            We believe that art is a powerful tool and that is why we choose to
            use it within all of our projects. The most common type of campaign
            we run involves setting up pre-prepared canvases in a public space
            and encouraging members of the public to write anonymous messages of 
            hope. But always remember that we enjoy using art in many different 
            ways and are able to adjust our projects to suit any target audience.
